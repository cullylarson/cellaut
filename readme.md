# CellAut

> Terrible pseudo-cellular automata thing.

It got confusing.  I got bored, gave up.  The "framework" I came up with to do it turned out poorly.  I think using ImmutableJS might actually be part of the problem.  Made it difficult to understand what was really getting changed.  Anyway, I might pick it back up.
